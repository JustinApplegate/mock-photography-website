          and he did not disappoint! He picked the perfect location and was a dream to work with. He was so kind and did amazing 
          working with our dog and six month old baby girl. We are in love with our photos and will be using Justin for all future 
          photoshoots. So happy!"</p><p>- Benjamin Franklin</p></div>

        <div class="quote"><p>"Justin was absolutely amazing. He is worth every penny spent. Our photos 
          turned out great for our engagements and we are super excited to see what he produces for us during our wedding. If you 
          are on the fence about a photographer, then definitely go with Justin!!! You won’t be disappointed one bit."</p><p>- George Washington</p></div>

        <div class="quote"><p>"Justin is an amazing photographer and so fun to work with! We'd planned to do bridals and then our 
          wedding photos with him, but when COVID happened we had to postpone our reception an entire year and Justin was responsive 
          and supportive while we decided what to do. Then he went above and beyond to make our bridals work and do an elopement 
          photo shoot with us this summer! I've been so impressed by all the photos we've gotten back from him and can't wait to do 
          even more next year."</p><p>- Abraham Lincoln</p></div>
