    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Justin Applegate, and I've been doing photography for over 6 years! Me and my wife Charlotte have been married for 5 years
       and have 1 little boy, Chandler. We both attended and graduated from Brigham Young University in Provo, UT and have only recently moved 
       here to Phoenix. We love to hike, watch TV, take naps (when we can :p), and play sports.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions for me, please contact me at <a href="mailto:justink.applegate@gmail.com">justink.applegate@gmail.com</a>. I would
       be happy to answer any questions you may have!</p>
